# WT20-2021
The web scraping project on the T20 World Cup held last year from the ESPNCricinfo Website by using node js libraries cheerio and request.
The aim of the project was to collect statistics such as runs scored, number of 4s, 6s, and the strike rate of the batsmen playing
in the squad during the entire world cup. It will generate every player's performance under their respective national team folder
in separate excel sheet.
